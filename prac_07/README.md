About the Author

Hi! I'm a student currently enrolled in CP1404, learning about good programming practices and clean code. This project is part of my journey towards mastering Python programming and building practical applications.

Clean Code Lessons Learned

During the development of this project, I learned several important lessons about writing clean, maintainable code:

Separation of Concerns: Keeping functions focused on a single task makes the code easier to understand and maintain.

Descriptive Naming: Using clear and descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes helps others (and future me) understand the code quickly.

Error Handling: Adding error handling for file operations and user inputs ensures that the program behaves gracefully under unexpected conditions.
